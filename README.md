# gh-repo-downloader
This is a simple python script that will git clone any repo in the repos.txt file and store it locally in the cloned_repos folder.

The repos.txt file isn't meant to be the master list of repos, i suggest that is stored elsewhere, and then generated out.

You can change the location of the cloned_repos folder and the repos.txt file in the config.ini.

## run
to run the program, just type

```bash
python main.py
```

## future
in the future, it'd be good to store this off in a snapshot in cloud object storage.  i'm also equally happy just to store it on a drive somewhere.
